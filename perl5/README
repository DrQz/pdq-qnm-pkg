Note:

You will need root access in order to be able to install
the PERL module in the system direcory (/usr/local/lib/perl5??)

The following error messages are typical of what you will see
if you attempt a 'make install' with insufficient privileges:

   Warning: You do not have permissions to install into /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/... 
       at /usr/lib/perl5/5.8.0/ExtUtils/Install.pm line 84.
   ...
   ...
   Can't open file /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0/...: Permission denied
       at /usr/lib/perl5/5.8.0/ExtUtils/Install.pm line 167
   make: *** [pure_site_install] Error 255

If you do not have root privileges you will need to install the
PERL module to a local directory.

to Do this edit the Makefile.PL script and add the follwong line into
the WriteMakefile block:

   'DESTDIR' => '${HOME}/',
   'PREFIX'  => '/',

or alternatively (but this adds lib/perl into the path a second time!):

   'DESTDIR' => '${HOME}/lib',
   'PREFIX'  => '/perl5',

Now build and run the install:

   $ make
   ...

   $ make install
   Files found in blib/arch: installing files in blib/lib into architecture dependent library tree
   Writing /home/users/njg/lib/usr/local/lib/perl/5.8.7/auto/pdq/.packlist
   Appending installation info to /home/users/njg/lib/usr/local/lib/perl/5.8.7/perllocal.pod

Edit your profile and add the following environment variable:

FOR CYGWIN
----------

   export PERL5LIB=${HOME}/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8/cygwin

On a Linux system the above worked fine.

However, under cygwin I needed to append 'auto/pdq' to get this to work! 
Not required now (2002-12-27), the above path worked fine - not sure why?

   export PERL5LIB=${HOME}/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8/cygwin/auto/pdq

This tells PERL to look in your local library directory.  Note, the path should match
the path as shown in the Writing line from the output in the install transcript.



FOR MACOSX
----------
Depending on the shell, use export or setenv

setenv PERL5LIB .../lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.6/darwin-thread-multi-2level/


FOR CYGWIN ON VISTA
-------------------

You may need to change the permissions on the folder to which the modules will
be installed. If this is the case you will see a message:
  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  ERROR: Can't create '/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.10/i686-cygwin'
  Do not have write permissions on '/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.10/i686-cygwin'
  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The path name may vary depending on the location of your Cygwin install and
your Perl version. Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the folder in the
error message. Right click on this folder and choose properties. In the
Security tab of the i686-cygwin Properties box click the Edit button. Click
Users, check the Allow box for Modify permission, and click OK until you are
back to Windows Explorer. You may now attempt the install again, and it
should complete successfully.
