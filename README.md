# PDQ: Pretty Damn Quick 

PDQ is an analytic solver library for queueing-network models (QNM) of computer systems,
manufacturing systems, and data networks, optionally written in conventional programming
languages. Predicted performance metrics that result
from solving a PDQ model can easily be displayed using the generic `Report()`
function or creating customized reports based on specific performance metrics.
