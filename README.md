# PDQ: Pretty Damn Quick 

PDQ is an analytic solver library for queueing-network models (QNM) of computer systems,
manufacturing systems, and data networks, optionally written in a variety of conventional programming
languages. Predicted performance metrics that result
from solving a PDQ model can easily be displayed using the generic `Report()`
function or creating customized reports based on 
[specific performance metrics](http://www.perfdynamics.com/Tools/PDQman.html).
