# PDQ: Pretty Damn Quick 

PDQ is an analytic solver library for queueing-network models (QNM) of computer
systems, manufacturing systems, and data networks, that can be written
optionally in a variety of conventional programming languages (see below). 
Perl is the language used in the book 
[Analyzing Computer System Performance with Perl::PDQ](http://www.perfdynamics.com/iBook/ppa_new.html), 
which explains the fundamental concepts with example models for computer system performance.

Predicted performance metrics that result from solving a PDQ model can easily be displayed
using the generic `Report()` function or creating customized reports based on 
[specific performance metrics](http://www.perfdynamics.com/Tools/PDQman.html) 
like, `GetUtilization()` or `GetThruput()`.
