Description: The PDQ performance analyzer uses queueing-theory concepts to represent computer systems and analyze their performance characteristics.  It is a queueing model solver, not a simulator.  The queueing-theory models discussed in \emph{Analyzing Computer System Performance with Perl::PDQ} are incorporated into the solution methods used by PDQ.
