\title{ Get Utilization for Node }
\description{
Determine the utilization of the designated service node by the specified workload.  It should only be called after the PDQ model has been solved.
}
\usage{
GetUtilization(device, work, class)
}
\arguments{
  \item{device}{ String containing the name of the queueing service node. }
  \item{work}{ String containing the name of the workload. }
  \item{class}{ TRANS, TERM, or BATCH type. }
}
\details{
The classes of workloads are:
\describe{
\item{ TRANS }{ a workload that is defined by arrival rate, not think time; only valid for an open circuit }
\item{ TERM }{ a workload with non-zero think time: there will be \code{think} delay before requests re-enter the system; only valid for a closed circuit }
\item{ BATCH }{ a workload with no think time: requests immediately re-enter the system; only valid for a closed circuit }
}
}
\value{
  Utilization as a decimal fraction in the range 0.0 to 1.0.
