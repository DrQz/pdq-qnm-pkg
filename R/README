PDQ-R is new to this release, and has been tested to work on Linux, MacOS X,
Windows, and OpenSolaris.

A pre-compiled Windows binary is available as a separate download. Otherwise
Windows users need to download and install Rtools for Windows from
http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/index.html.

If you do not have R installed, you can download it from:
