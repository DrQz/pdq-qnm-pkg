What's here?


Makefile	Compile these PDQ models.

README		This here file.

open1.c		OPEN circuit queue with a single server.
		Requests arrive at specified rate and leave the system.

closed1.c	Single CLOSED circuit queue with single server and
 		fixed number of requests.

erlang.c	Single queue with multiple servers. This is the exact
		solution calculated using the algorithms in the book.

comments.pdq	Text entered in this file will appear near the beginning
		of the output generated by PDQ_Report().

		The idea is to update these comments with each edit of
		of your PDQ model. It is intended to provide a lazy way
		to keep track of changes you make to you model. At some
		point you will ask yourself, "Why did I do that!?"
		Accurate comments may help you to remember.
