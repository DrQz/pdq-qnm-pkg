Python PDQ (PyDQ) model descriptions:

--------------


mm1.py

    A simple M/M/1 implemented in PyDQ.
--------------

call-center.py

   Multiserver model of a Customer Help Center that use CreateMultiNode in PDQ.


--------------

bookstore.py

    PyDQ model of a brick-and-mortar bookstore, like Barnes & Noble, which involves
    two very different stages of customer activity: browsing and buying. Browsing
    has the longest mean service time but does not incur any waiting, while buying
    typically does, even though it has a relatively shorter mean service time. The
    key concept is to represent the browsing stage by a PDQ MutliNode with a large
    number of servers, sufficient to avoid forming any waiting line at all. This is
    how we represent an "infinite service center".
