PDQ model descriptions:

bookstore.c    C language implementation
bookstore.py   Python version of same

	PDQ model of a brick-and-mortar bookstore, like Barnes & Noble, which involves
	two very different stages of customer activity: browsing and buying. Browsing
	has the longest mean service time but does not incur any waiting, while buying
	typically does, even though it has a relatively shorter mean service time. The
	key concept is to represent the browsing stage by a PDQ MutliNode with a large
	number of servers, sufficient to avoid forming any waiting line at all. This is
	how we represent an "infinite service center".
--------------


diskoptim.pl   Perl PDQ model

	An old performance chestnut that many queueing theory experts get wrong. It's
	essentially a load-balancing problem involving how to apportion IO requests
	across a fast and slow disk.
--------------


floggit.py     Python PDQ model

	A simple M/M/1 implemented in PyDQ.
--------------


gross_pdq42.c   C language implementation
gross_te42.py   Python version of same
gross_te43.py   Python version of Example 4.3

	Examples in Gross and Harris (p. 181, 3rd edn).

jackpdq.py     Python PDQ model
jacksim.py     Python simulator model

	A PyDQ model of the SimPy simulator example described here  
	http://www.perfdynamics.com/Tools/PDQpython.html#tth_sEc4.2
	This model is a Jackson network comprising three queueing nodes and a set of branching  
	probabilities for the three workload streams. 
--------------


passport.py    Python PDQ model

	Python PDQ model in PPA book Example 3-3 on p. 96 ff. See ppa_1998/chap3/passport.c
--------------


spamcan.pl     Perl PDQ model

	Queueing model of an email spam analyzer farm comprising a battery of 4-way
	multicore servers all essentially running in batch mode. The performance metric of
	interest is the average queue length.
--------------


threadapp.pl   Perl PDQ model

	Flow-equivalent Service Center (FESC) mode of a threaded application.
