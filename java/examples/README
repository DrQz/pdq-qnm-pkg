These notes depend on having your Java environment set up properly!

Chapter 8 versions of programs predate the last rework of the original C
programs done by Neil in 2006. They need to be re-done.



1)  To compile all programs

Type:

  $ make

to compile all java programs

This invokes the compile_all script:

  $ ./compile_all.sh

Alternatively a rudimentary ant build file exists an so you could also type:

  $ ant

if you have ant installed and configure properly.

2) To compile indivisual programs

Individual programs may be compiled as follows:

  $ ./compile.sh Ch_Baseline.java

3)  To test the suite of examples

To test the suite of examples type:

  $ make test

4)  To clean up.

Type:

  $ make clean

or

  $ ant clean
