This Java port implements the PDQ v4.2 APIs in pure Java. Among other
things, this means that it lacks the support for multiserver queues
that was introduced in v5.0. Plans for the next PDQ release call for
this pure-Java implementation to be dropped in favor of a JNI-based
implementation that will support the same APIs as all other PDQ
flavors (C, Perl, Python, and R). The use of SWIG-generated JNI wrapper
code introduces a dependence on a native shared library (a dependence
that the Perl and Python have always had), but makes it easier to
maintain a Java implementation that keeps up with changes to the PDQ
APIs.






Problem with Ch7_abcache - am looking for job streams which don't
exist and this caused and exeption. I have put special case
handling in getjob_index() and GetUtilization() to return zero
values if a job is not found (jobIdx = -1). Is this the best way
to handle this?

Need to do more analysis of this problem! 2004-02-20
