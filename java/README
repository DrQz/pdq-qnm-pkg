Problem with Ch7_abcache - am looking for job streams which don't
exist and this caused and exeption.  I have put special case
handling in getjob_index() and GetUtilization() to return zero
values if a job is not found (jobIdx = -1).  Is this the best way
to handle this?

Need to do more analysis of this problem!  2004-02-20
