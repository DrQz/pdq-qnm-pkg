# Queueing model of an email-spam analyzer system comprising a
# battery of SMP servers essentially running in batch mode.
# Each node was a 4-way SMP server.
# The performance metric of interest was the mean queue length.
#
# This simple M/M/4 model gave results that were in surprisingly
# good agreement with monitored queue lengths.
