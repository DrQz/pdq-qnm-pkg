#
#	PDQ model using 2 MSQ multi-server nodes in tandem.
#   Here, prototype MSQ node is replaced by documented CreateMultiNode function.
#   See http://www.perfdynamics.com/Tools/PDQman.html#tth_sEc3.2
#	
#	Big book stores like Barnes & Noble or Borders allow customers to
#	enter, browse and read books, have coffee, eat, listen to CDs and
#	finally head to the checkout area. The checkout consists of a single
#	waiting line serviced by multiple cashiers. Such a big book store can
#	be modeled as M/M/inf (browsing) and M/M/m (checkout).
#
#	The PDQ model parameters are taken from Example 4.1 (p.170) in Gross
#	and Harris, "Fundamentals of Queueing Theory," 3rd edn. (1998) which
#	discusses a grocery store with a "lounge". (??)
#	
#	The capacity planning question is:
#		Currently, only 3 employees are paid to act as cashiers.
#		If the store mgr pays a 4th cashier, what happens to the:
#		1. waiting time at the checkout?
#		2. length of the waiting line?
#		3. mean number of people in the store 
#		
#	The only only parameter that might be made more realistic for this
#	bookstore example, is the browsing time, e.g., increase to 65 mins.
